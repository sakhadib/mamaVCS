## **Troubleshooting**
1. **'mama' is not recognized as a command**:
   - Ensure the directory containing `mama.exe` is added to the **PATH** and restart your terminal.

2. **Permission issues**:
   - Try running the terminal as **Administrator**.

3. **Repository not initialized**:
   - Make sure to run:
     ```bash
     mama shuru
     ```
   - This creates the required `.mama` folder to store your repository data.
